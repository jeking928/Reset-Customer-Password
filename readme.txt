This plugin allows you to reset a customer password from the Admin.  You can search for a customer by their email address.

Installation
--------------
No warranties expressed or implied; use at your own risk.

1) Rename YOUR-AMDIN to that of your admin folder. There are no core file over-rides, so upload all files.
2) If you're using Zen Cart 1.5.x, run sql 'add_admin_menu_entry_v15x.sql'.  If you are using a table prefix, you MUST EDIT the sql statement or you will get an error. For example, if your table prefix is 'zen_' change 'admin_pages' to 'zen_admin_pages'.
